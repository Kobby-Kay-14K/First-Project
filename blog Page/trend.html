      <h2>Trending Hairstyles in 2025</h2>
      <p>Hairstyles in 2025 are all about blending <strong>classic looks with modern textures</strong>. Whether you prefer a sharp, professional cut or a relaxed, effortless vibe, this year’s trends have something for everyone.</p>
  
      <h3>1. Textured Crop with a Skin Fade</h3>
      <p>This style combines short, choppy layers on top with a clean fade on the sides. It’s low-maintenance yet stylish, perfect for guys who want a modern edge.</p>
  
      <h3>2. Modern Pompadour</h3>
      <p>The pompadour is back, but with a softer, natural texture. Instead of heavy gel, barbers recommend lightweight matte products for a relaxed volume.</p>
  
      <h3>3. Messy Fringe Look</h3>
      <p>The messy fringe gives off a casual, youthful vibe. It’s especially popular among younger clients who want a stylish but laid-back haircut.</p>
  
      <h3>4. Classic Side Part Revival</h3>
      <p>A timeless cut that never goes out of style. In 2025, it’s making a comeback with sharper fades and clean parting lines for a polished finish.</p>
  
      <h3>5. Long Hair with Natural Waves</h3>
      <p>For men who prefer length, natural waves are in. This look works best when paired with regular trims and conditioning to keep hair healthy and manageable.</p>
